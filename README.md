# Parakeet
<br/>
Parakeet is a toolset for those who want to extend the capabilities or integrate their projects with the popular [Macaw](http://www.macaw.co) web design tool. 

## Install
<br/>
We're working to bring Parakeet to package manager. In the meantime, you'll need to...

* Create a directory within your /[project name]/node_modules named 'parakeet'.
* Download all source files.
* Paste these into your parakeet directory.
* Manually into your node_modules directory.
* Add parakeet as a dependency in your package.json.

## Requirements
<br/>
Parakeet will not chirp without [Macaw](http://www.macaw.co) by it's side. The current version of Parakeet is built to fly with [Macaw](http://www.macaw.co) Version 1.5.14. You'll need to install [Macaw](http://www.macaw.co) for the operations of Parakeet to make any sense.


## Development
<br/>
Parakeet (and its components) are developed using tools built in JavaScript running on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).

The individual components are developed in their own GitHub repositories.

##Issues
<br/>
If you encounter issues with a component, please file issues against the individual component repositories.
